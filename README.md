Every institution has examination held at particular interval. There are many courses and in each course there are number of student.
The administrator need to count the total number students registered, and then he needs to select the rooms and divide the student among those rooms.
He should also prepare sitting arrangement list for each room based upon the count. Its very time consuming and difficult for the administrator to make manually.		

This system “EXAMINATION SEATING ARRANGEMENT” will allocate the student to their desire location automatically.
The administrator need to provide only the number of rooms, details of the student in a simple excel sheet and number of student per room. 
Based on administrator constraint this will generate sitting arrangements in automatic way on single click
